# sprintato
A Discord bot for writing sprints built on node and discordjs. Inspired by Sprinto.

1. Go and do the stuff you need to do on Discord to make a bot and get your bot token and whatnot. Don't forget to invite to your Discord-server!

2. Create a config.json that looks like this:
  ```
  {
      "prefix": "<Some prefix, recommended is exclamation mark>",
      "token": "<YOUR BOT TOKEN>"
  }
  ```

3. Run
  `npm install discord.js`

4. Run
  `node index.js`
